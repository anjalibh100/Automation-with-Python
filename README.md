API's : Two programmatic interfaces to interact for data transfer
REST API's can be accessed using Python Library (import requests)
Python API will get data from the News API. News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. (https://newsapi.org/docs)
Once you have the api, you can also access the news using api-key :
